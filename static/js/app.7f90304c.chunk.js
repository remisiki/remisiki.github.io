Memory allocation is quite tough to use, yet later finding it quite useful since no other high level languages (except Rust maybe) can manage memory so directly. I know C is more widely used in hardware programming, but I have no practical experience in that and no plans to dig more into it currently...","pascal":"Studied as the first programming language. Used to use Turbo Pascal and Free Pascal as my IDE, and I still remember the blue background and some keyboard shortcuts which reminds me of the old-day programming atmosphere. I attended several programming matches in Pascal, but later turned to C++ instead since I do not want to write sort by hand every time :)","cpp":"Used as the main programming language in my high school days, though I cannot believe that I learnt it all on my own without Google or StackOverflow. Used to use Dev-CPP as IDE, but turned to text editor + terminal later. I like C++ very much, but have not been coding in C++ for so long since entering university that it is hard for me to develop a project in C++ now...","java":"A widely used language exclaiming to be better than C++. I do not know very well about JVM, but I think it is quite strong. The programming style fascinates me a lot, and I prefer to use Java to develop a non-script software at present. I used Eclipse Java during my internship, but I do prefer to use text editor + terminal for personal projects (cannot get used to IDE anyway, personally).","scala":"A scalable language developed based on Java, but the style is somehow quite similar to Elm and Python. I came to know about Scala from Apache Spark packages and I believe Scala can be a quite powerful tool in machine learning other than Python. I only know about general grammar at present and have written a small web backend with PlayFramework.","python":"Very convenient script and machine learning tool. It takes no time to write a Python script, so I often use it when I am lazy enough. I am currently studying machine learning in Python, but I do not like it quite much since Python\'s performance is so poor and also too hard to maintain as a big project. I hope that Python can be replaced one day, honestly.","riscv":"Learnt as a meta language in some college course. Assembly is interesting, yet too difficult to actually code on. May also want to learn about x86-64 Assembly, not knowing why and what to use for.","verilog":"A hardware description language. Quite convenient to use, but also drives one mad on some timing problems. Once in a period I liked hardware coding a lot, however, I am not planning to work more with it in the future.","vb":"An out-dated user interface design tool. I suppose that no one will use it nowadays... And I learnt it quite a couple of years ago to produce many small programs that I cannot find them today. What I do remember is that IDE will alert you a syntax error if accidently leaving a line without completing it :)","javascript":"A powerful frontend language. I first got to know JavaScript when taking a course that taught Elm.js, a language that nobody should have known about. Elm is a functional programming language, and I find it quite fresh to write functions in a pipeline style. But still, I do not like building environments overall, so I preferred to write pure JavaScript with HTML and CSS before using React.js. React is convenient, and there appears to be quite many things for me to dig in web design. I can only write simple static webpages right now, and may want to learn more about dynamic ones in the future.","ifh":"About Remisiki","ifp0":"Remisiki is a junior student major in ECE (Electrical & Computing Engineering), who likes programming and single-player games.","ifs0":"Languages","ifs1":"Programming","ifs2":"Interests","ifenp0":"Can read most English without difficulties, but writing and speaking is not very good... If you find some words improper here or in other my pages, please let me know!","ifenp1":"I have been taking all my undergraduate courses in English, so I think there is no problem with my professional English. But when actually travelling to English-speaking countries, I found native speakers all talking so fast that I could not understand them...","ifenp2":"Personally speaking, I like British accents since they always sound quite \\"gentlemen\\" (?).","ifcnp0":"Both Peking Mandarin and Taiwan Mandarin are OK with me. For writing, I prefer traditional Chinese (they are nicer). In fact, modern Chinese pronunciation (Mandarin) is too simple and I do not like it very much... If possible, I will talk in Shanghainese instead.","ifshp0":"Native language, spoken from my earliest childhood. I like it, but few people know about Shanghainese nowadays :(","ifhkp0":"Not so familiar with, but know many about it. Maybe better at listening than speaking? Since there is no chance for me to practice speaking Cantonese (at least now).","ifhkp1":"Pronunciations are very interesting, and many similar points can be found between Cantonese and Japanese Kanji. ","ifjap0":"Quite familiar with, yet still far from mastering. Listening and reading are OK, but writing Japanese needs google translate sometimes... My words written in Japanese may seem a bit strange and please let me know if so.","ifdep0":"Knows very limited about it.

For details of achievements, see the Game tab.","ifs2l0l0p1":"Favorite Touhou game is TH12 \u6771\u65b9\u661f\u84ee\u8239 \uff5e Undefined Fantastic Object; Others like TH06 \u6771\u65b9\u7d05\u9b54\u90f7 \uff5e the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, TH11 \u6771\u65b9\u5730\u970a\u6bbf \u301c Subterranean Animism are also excellent. I bought both CD and Steam version for these three games, and I think their game content and music are among the best of all Touhou games. Although I also played the new games as soon as they are released, I do not think they are better than those before, so gradually I stopped playing Touhou anymore...","ifs2l0l0p2":"My favorite Touhou character is Remilia Scarlet, and that\'s where my name Remisiki came from. Vampire is good!","ifs2l0l1p0":"Started playing CAVE games since 2019. At first, I could only play them on PC simulators with keyboard; Then in 2020 I bought a joystick controller so that I could practice CAVE at home, which helped me a lot when I actually go to Rekka Game Center in Shanghai to play on real arcade machines.","ifs2l0l1p1":"Favorite CAVE game is Dodonpachi Daioujou, and favorite music is \u300eStage 5: EVAC INDUSTRY-\u5be9\u5224\u306e\u65e5\u300f. I do not own a PS4/Xbox 360, so I can only buy a few of CAVE games at present, sadly; Hope that more CAVE games can be tranplanted to Steam in recent years.","ifs2l1l0p0":"Hollow Knight is my first Metroroidvania game. I started playing it since late 2019 (expecting Silksong to be released soon), and have spent around 1,000 hours on it until now. Hollow Knight is a wonderful game with plentiful contents and excellent operation experience; Later I mainly ran on Randomizer MOD and Any% Speedrun, but now I have decided to stop playing it until Silksong is released (hope it will).","ifs2l1l1p0":"Ender Lilies is my second favorite Metroroidvania game. I first played it\'s early access on 2021 and liked it quite much. The story is excellent but too short... I would be very satisfied if the game had been developed into a bigger one so that I could spend more time in it. Currently I run Randomizer MOD and 100% Map Speedrun for Ender Lilies.","ifs2l1l1p1":"It seems that not so many Metroroidvania players know about Ender Lilies, and I think it should receive more attentions than now.","ifs2l1l2p0":"Just started playing Ori 1, and currently stopping for perhaps several months. I think it is more difficult than Hollow Knight or Ender Lilies, and some new moving skills are quite cool. Yes, a hard game.","ifs2l2l0p0":"Steins;Gate is one of the best game I\'ve ever played. Already spent 50 hours on it, but still far from all achievements. I think it is quite hard to reach the true ending without viewing strategy guides, and the saving slots are not enough to do it all on one\'s own though.","ifs2l2l0p1":"Favorite character is Faris NyanNyan, cried a lot when sacrificing her to reach other ends :( Besides, music is very good and I can recall all of them clearly; I even set \u300eGATE OF STINER -Piano-\u300f as my ringtone!","ifs2l2l1p0":"Steins;Gate 0 can be seen as a sequel or Part 0 of Steins;Gate. But I think they should be combined together to construct a complete story, since Steins;Gate 0 is necessary to reach Steins;Gate.","ifs2l2l1p1":"As a game itself, I think Steins;Gate 0 is really wonderful and does not lose to Steins;Gate. The true ending route is more interesting and strongly connected to other routes, so all routes are important to understand the whole story.","ifs2l2l1p2":"The music is undoubtedly excellent, sometimes rearranging with Steins;Gate. Waiting for so long before the Reawake appears though.","ifs2l2l2p0":"I played htoL#NiQ mainly because the girl in this game is really similar to that in Ender Lilies (cute) and there are some Metroroidvania elements other than riddle solving.","ifs2l2l2p1":"This game is extremely hard. I still cannot complete the last several achievements, and the mouse operation is so tough for me. Despite the difficulty, it is a wonderful game and I would also like to try other Nipponichi games in the future.","ifs2l3l0p0":"Steins;Gate is already my favorite Anime before playing the games, and I like it even more after rewatching it with all game routes cleared.","ifs2l3l0p1":"The most touching scene in Steins;Gate is that Okarin stabbed himself when trying to save Makise, and in Steins;Gate 0 is that Okarin reawaked and laughed UAHAHAHAHA for two minutes.","ifs2l3l0p2":"Although the science part of Steins;Gate is very simple and makes no sense, the works itself is in fact the best among all time travelling fictions I have ever watched. I strongly recommend watching Steins;Gate if anyone haven\'t!","ifs2l3l1p0":"Psychopass is a Cyberpunk Anime about criminals, and it gives me lots of deep thoughts that I have never seen elsewhere. The first season of Psychopass is written by Urobuchi Gen, which I think is far better than the sequels. The second season is obviously a little disappointing, but the third season brings some new ideas and is very interesting. I am very curious about what stories will be like next.","ifs2l3l2p0":"Monogatari series are about mysteries. The author made everyone into a Kaii so as to talk about humanities. The novels are already interesting enough, yet I was more deeply impressed by the Anime version developed by Sinbou Akiyuki. To be frank, I have never expected an Anime to go beyond its original work, except for Monogatari.","gmh":"Game Achievements","gms0":"Touhou","gms1":"CAVE","gms2":"Hollow

Memory allocation is quite tough to use, yet later finding it quite useful since no other high level languages (except Rust maybe) can manage memory so directly. I know C is more widely used in hardware programming, but I have no practical experience in that and no plans to dig more into it currently...","pascal":"Studied as the first programming language. Used to use Turbo Pascal and Free Pascal as my IDE, and I still remember the blue background and some keyboard shortcuts which reminds me of the old-day programming atmosphere. I attended several programming matches in Pascal, but later turned to C++ instead since I do not want to write sort by hand every time :)","cpp":"Used as the main programming language in my high school days, though I cannot believe that I learnt it all on my own without Google or StackOverflow. Used to use Dev-CPP as IDE, but turned to text editor + terminal later. I like C++ very much, but have not been coding in C++ for so long since entering university that it is hard for me to develop a project in C++ now...","java":"A widely used language exclaiming to be better than C++. I do not know very well about JVM, but I think it is quite strong. The programming style fascinates me a lot, and I prefer to use Java to develop a non-script software at present. I used Eclipse Java during my internship, but I do prefer to use text editor + terminal for personal projects (cannot get used to IDE anyway, personally).","scala":"A scalable language developed based on Java, but the style is somehow quite similar to Elm and Python. I came to know about Scala from Apache Spark packages and I believe Scala can be a quite powerful tool in machine learning other than Python. I only know about general grammar at present and have written a small web backend with PlayFramework.","python":"Very convenient script and machine learning tool. It takes no time to write a Python script, so I often use it when I am lazy enough. I am currently studying machine learning in Python, but I do not like it quite much since Python\'s performance is so poor and also too hard to maintain as a big project. I hope that Python can be replaced one day, honestly.","riscv":"Learnt as a meta language in some college course. Assembly is interesting, yet too difficult to actually code on. May also want to learn about x86-64 Assembly, not knowing why and what to use for.","verilog":"A hardware description language. Quite convenient to use, but also drives one mad on some timing problems. Once in a period I liked hardware coding a lot, however, I am not planning to work more with it in the future.","vb":"An out-dated user interface design tool. I suppose that no one will use it nowadays... And I learnt it quite a couple of years ago to produce many small programs that I cannot find them today. What I do remember is that IDE will alert you a syntax error if accidently leaving a line without completing it :)","javascript":"A powerful frontend language. I first got to know JavaScript when taking a course that taught Elm.js, a language that nobody should have known about. Elm is a functional programming language, and I find it quite fresh to write functions in a pipeline style. But still, I do not like building environments overall, so I preferred to write pure JavaScript with HTML and CSS before using React.js. React is convenient, and there appears to be quite many things for me to dig in web design. I can only write simple static webpages right now, and may want to learn more about dynamic ones in the future.","ifh":"About Remisiki","ifp0":"Remisiki is a junior student major in ECE (Electrical & Computing Engineering), who likes programming and single-player games.","ifs0":"Languages","ifs1":"Programming","ifs2":"Interests","ifenp0":"Can read most English without difficulties, but writing and speaking is not very good... If you find some words improper here or in other my pages, please let me know!","ifenp1":"I have been taking all my undergraduate courses in English, so I think there is no problem with my professional English. But when actually travelling to English-speaking countries, I found native speakers all talking so fast that I could not understand them...","ifenp2":"Personally speaking, I like British accents since they always sound quite \\"gentlemen\\" (?).","ifcnp0":"Both Peking Mandarin and Taiwan Mandarin are OK with me. For writing, I prefer traditional Chinese (they are nicer). In fact, modern Chinese pronunciation (Mandarin) is too simple and I do not like it very much... If possible, I will talk in Shanghainese instead.","ifshp0":"Native language, spoken from my earliest childhood. I like it, but few people know about Shanghainese nowadays :(","ifhkp0":"Not so familiar with, but know many about it. Maybe better at listening than speaking? Since there is no chance for me to practice speaking Cantonese (at least now).","ifhkp1":"Pronunciations are very interesting, and many similar points can be found between Cantonese and Japanese Kanji. ","ifjap0":"Quite familiar with, yet still far from mastering. Listening and reading are OK, but writing Japanese needs google translate sometimes... My words written in Japanese may seem a bit strange and please let me know if so.","ifdep0":"Knows very limited about it.

For details of achievements, see the Game tab.","ifs2l0l0p1":"Favorite Touhou game is TH12 \u6771\u65b9\u661f\u84ee\u8239 \uff5e Undefined Fantastic Object; Others like TH06 \u6771\u65b9\u7d05\u9b54\u90f7 \uff5e the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, TH11 \u6771\u65b9\u5730\u970a\u6bbf \u301c Subterranean Animism are also excellent. I bought both CD and Steam version for these three games, and I think their game content and music are among the best of all Touhou games. Although I also played the new games as soon as they are released, I do not think they are better than those before, so gradually I stopped playing Touhou anymore...","ifs2l0l0p2":"My favorite Touhou character is Remilia Scarlet, and that\'s where my name Remisiki came from. Vampire is good!","ifs2l0l1p0":"Started playing CAVE games since 2019. At first, I could only play them on PC simulators with keyboard; Then in 2020 I bought a joystick controller so that I could practice CAVE at home, which helped me a lot when I actually go to Rekka Game Center in Shanghai to play on real arcade machines.","ifs2l0l1p1":"Favorite CAVE game is Dodonpachi Daioujou, and favorite music is \u300eStage 5: EVAC INDUSTRY-\u5be9\u5224\u306e\u65e5\u300f. I do not own a PS4/Xbox 360, so I can only buy a few of CAVE games at present, sadly; Hope that more CAVE games can be tranplanted to Steam in recent years.","ifs2l1l0p0":"Hollow Knight is my first Metroroidvania game. I started playing it since late 2019 (expecting Silksong to be released soon), and have spent around 1,000 hours on it until now. Hollow Knight is a wonderful game with plentiful contents and excellent operation experience; Later I mainly ran on Randomizer MOD and Any% Speedrun, but now I have decided to stop playing it until Silksong is released (hope it will).","ifs2l1l1p0":"Ender Lilies is my second favorite Metroroidvania game. I first played it\'s early access on 2021 and liked it quite much. The story is excellent but too short... I would be very satisfied if the game had been developed into a bigger one so that I could spend more time in it. Currently I run Randomizer MOD and 100% Map Speedrun for Ender Lilies.","ifs2l1l1p1":"It seems that not so many Metroroidvania players know about Ender Lilies, and I think it should receive more attentions than now.","ifs2l1l2p0":"Just started playing Ori 1, and currently stopping for perhaps several months. I think it is more difficult than Hollow Knight or Ender Lilies, and some new moving skills are quite cool. Yes, a hard game.","ifs2l2l0p0":"Steins;Gate is one of the best game I\'ve ever played. Already spent 50 hours on it, but still far from all achievements. I think it is quite hard to reach the true ending without viewing strategy guides, and the saving slots are not enough to do it all on one\'s own though.","ifs2l2l0p1":"Favorite character is Faris NyanNyan, cried a lot when sacrificing her to reach other ends :( Besides, music is very good and I can recall all of them clearly; I even set \u300eGATE OF STINER -Piano-\u300f as my ringtone!","ifs2l2l1p0":"Steins;Gate 0 can be seen as a sequel or Part 0 of Steins;Gate. But I think they should be combined together to construct a complete story, since Steins;Gate 0 is necessary to reach Steins;Gate.","ifs2l2l1p1":"As a game itself, I think Steins;Gate 0 is really wonderful and does not lose to Steins;Gate. The true ending route is more interesting and strongly connected to other routes, so all routes are important to understand the whole story.","ifs2l2l1p2":"The music is undoubtedly excellent, sometimes rearranging with Steins;Gate. Waiting for so long before the Reawake appears though.","ifs2l2l2p0":"I played htoL#NiQ mainly because the girl in this game is really similar to that in Ender Lilies (cute) and there are some Metroroidvania elements other than riddle solving.","ifs2l2l2p1":"This game is extremely hard. I still cannot complete the last several achievements, and the mouse operation is so tough for me. Despite the difficulty, it is a wonderful game and I would also like to try other Nipponichi games in the future.","ifs2l3l0p0":"Steins;Gate is already my favorite Anime before playing the games, and I like it even more after rewatching it with all game routes cleared.","ifs2l3l0p1":"The most touching scene in Steins;Gate is that Okarin stabbed himself when trying to save Makise, and in Steins;Gate 0 is that Okarin reawaked and laughed UAHAHAHAHA for two minutes.","ifs2l3l0p2":"Although the science part of Steins;Gate is very simple and makes no sense, the works itself is in fact the best among all time travelling fictions I have ever watched. I strongly recommend watching Steins;Gate if anyone haven\'t!","ifs2l3l1p0":"Psychopass is a Cyberpunk Anime about criminals, and it gives me lots of deep thoughts that I have never seen elsewhere. The first season of Psychopass is written by Urobuchi Gen, which I think is far better than the sequels. The second season is obviously a little disappointing, but the third season brings some new ideas and is very interesting. I am very curious about what stories will be like next.","ifs2l3l2p0":"Monogatari series are about mysteries. The author made everyone into a Kaii so as to talk about humanities. The novels are already interesting enough, yet I was more deeply impressed by the Anime version developed by Sinbou Akiyuki. To be frank, I have never expected an Anime to go beyond its original work, except for Monogatari.","gmh":"Game Achievements","gms0":"Touhou","gms1":"CAVE","gms2":"Hollow

What I do remember is that IDE will alert you a syntax error if accidently leaving a line without completing it :)","javascript":"A powerful frontend language. I first got to know JavaScript when taking a course that taught Elm.js, a language that nobody should have known about. Elm is a functional programming language, and I find it quite fresh to write functions in a pipeline style. But still, I do not like building environments overall, so I preferred to write pure JavaScript with HTML and CSS before using React.js. React is convenient, and there appears to be quite many things for me to dig in web design. I can only write simple static webpages right now, and may want to learn more about dynamic ones in the future.","ifh":"About Remisiki","ifp0":"Remisiki is a junior student major in ECE (Electrical & Computing Engineering), who likes programming and single-player games.","ifs0":"Languages","ifs1":"Programming","ifs2":"Interests","ifenp0":"Can read most English without difficulties, but writing and speaking is not very good... If you find some words improper here or in other my pages, please let me know!","ifenp1":"I have been taking all my undergraduate courses in English, so I think there is no problem with my professional English. But when actually travelling to English-speaking countries, I found native speakers all talking so fast that I could not understand them...","ifenp2":"Personally speaking, I like British accents since they always sound quite \\"gentlemen\\" (?).","ifcnp0":"Both Peking Mandarin and Taiwan Mandarin are OK with me. For writing, I prefer traditional Chinese (they are nicer). In fact, modern Chinese pronunciation (Mandarin) is too simple and I do not like it very much... If possible, I will talk in Shanghainese instead.","ifshp0":"Native language, spoken from my earliest childhood. I like it, but few people know about Shanghainese nowadays :(","ifhkp0":"Not so familiar with, but know many about it. Maybe better at listening than speaking? Since there is no chance for me to practice speaking Cantonese (at least now).","ifhkp1":"Pronunciations are very interesting, and many similar points can be found between Cantonese and Japanese Kanji. ","ifjap0":"Quite familiar with, yet still far from mastering. Listening and reading are OK, but writing Japanese needs google translate sometimes... My words written in Japanese may seem a bit strange and please let me know if so.","ifdep0":"Knows very limited about it. I have just started learning German, so conversations are not possible at present...","ifp1":"Click on the items to see more details!","ifp2":"My regular gears and favorite text editors for programming:","ifp2l0":"Desktop PC (Windows 10 with WSL Ubuntu)","ifp2l1":"Notebook PC (Manjaro Linux & Windows 11)","ifp2l2":"Sublime Text","ifs0l0":"English","ifs0l1":"Chinese","ifs0l2":"Japanese","ifs0l3":"German","ifs0l1l0":"Mandarin","ifs0l1l1":"Shanghainese","ifs0l1l2":"Cantonese","ifs2l0":"STG","ifs2l0l0":"Touhou","ifs2l0l1":"CAVE","ifs2l1":"Metroroidvania","ifs2l1l0":"Hollow Knight","ifs2l1l1":"Ender Lilies","ifs2l1l2":"Ori","ifs2l2":"Other games","ifs2l2l0":"Steins;Gate","ifs2l2l1":"Steins;Gate 0","ifs2l2l2":"htoL#NiQ","ifs2l3":"Anime","ifs2l3l0":"Steins;Gate","ifs2l3l1":"Psychopass","ifs2l3l2":"Monogatari","ifs2l0l0p0":"Started playing Touhou since 2016, and (almost) stopped after 2019. For details of achievements, see the Game tab.","ifs2l0l0p1":"Favorite Touhou game is TH12 \u6771\u65b9\u661f\u84ee\u8239 \uff5e Undefined Fantastic Object; Others like TH06 \u6771\u65b9\u7d05\u9b54\u90f7 \uff5e the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, TH11 \u6771\u65b9\u5730\u970a\u6bbf \u301c Subterranean Animism are also excellent. I bought both CD and Steam version for these three games, and I think their game content and music are among the best of all Touhou games. Although I also played the new games as soon as they are released, I do not think they are better than those before, so gradually I stopped playing Touhou anymore...","ifs2l0l0p2":"My favorite Touhou character is Remilia Scarlet, and that\'s where my name Remisiki came from. Vampire is good!","ifs2l0l1p0":"Started playing CAVE games since 2019. At first, I could only play them on PC simulators with keyboard; Then in 2020 I bought a joystick controller so that I could practice CAVE at home, which helped me a lot when I actually go to Rekka Game Center in Shanghai to play on real arcade machines.","ifs2l0l1p1":"Favorite CAVE game is Dodonpachi Daioujou, and favorite music is \u300eStage 5: EVAC INDUSTRY-\u5be9\u5224\u306e\u65e5\u300f. I do not own a PS4/Xbox 360, so I can only buy a few of CAVE games at present, sadly; Hope that more CAVE games can be tranplanted to Steam in recent years.","ifs2l1l0p0":"Hollow Knight is my first Metroroidvania game. I started playing it since late 2019 (expecting Silksong to be released soon), and have spent around 1,000 hours on it until now. Hollow Knight is a wonderful game with plentiful contents and excellent operation experience; Later I mainly ran on Randomizer MOD and Any% Speedrun, but now I have decided to stop playing it until Silksong is released (hope it will).","ifs2l1l1p0":"Ender Lilies is my second favorite Metroroidvania game. I first played it\'s early access on 2021 and liked it quite much. The story is excellent but too short... I would be very satisfied if the game had been developed into a bigger one so that I could spend more time in it. Currently I run Randomizer MOD and 100% Map Speedrun for Ender Lilies.","ifs2l1l1p1":"It seems that not so many Metroroidvania players know about Ender Lilies, and I think it should receive more attentions than now.","ifs2l1l2p0":"Just started playing Ori 1, and currently stopping for perhaps several months. I think it is more difficult than Hollow Knight or Ender Lilies, and some new moving skills are quite cool. Yes, a hard game.","ifs2l2l0p0":"Steins;Gate is one of the best game I\'ve ever played. Already spent 50 hours on it, but still far from all achievements. I think it is quite hard to reach the true ending without viewing strategy guides, and the saving slots are not enough to do it all on one\'s own though.","ifs2l2l0p1":"Favorite character is Faris NyanNyan, cried a lot when sacrificing her to reach other ends :( Besides, music is very good and I can recall all of them clearly; I even set \u300eGATE OF STINER -Piano-\u300f as my ringtone!","ifs2l2l1p0":"Steins;Gate 0 can be seen as a sequel or Part 0 of Steins;Gate. But I think they should be combined together to construct a complete story, since Steins;Gate 0 is necessary to reach Steins;Gate.","ifs2l2l1p1":"As a game itself, I think Steins;Gate 0 is really wonderful and does not lose to Steins;Gate. The true ending route is more interesting and strongly connected to other routes, so all routes are important to understand the whole story.","ifs2l2l1p2":"The music is undoubtedly excellent, sometimes rearranging with Steins;Gate. Waiting for so long before the Reawake appears though.","ifs2l2l2p0":"I played htoL#NiQ mainly because the girl in this game is really similar to that in Ender Lilies (cute) and there are some Metroroidvania elements other than riddle solving.","ifs2l2l2p1":"This game is extremely hard. I still cannot complete the last several achievements, and the mouse operation is so tough for me. Despite the difficulty, it is a wonderful game and I would also like to try other Nipponichi games in the future.","ifs2l3l0p0":"Steins;Gate is already my favorite Anime before playing the games, and I like it even more after rewatching it with all game routes cleared.","ifs2l3l0p1":"The most touching scene in Steins;Gate is that Okarin stabbed himself when trying to save Makise, and in Steins;Gate 0 is that Okarin reawaked and laughed UAHAHAHAHA for two minutes.","ifs2l3l0p2":"Although the science part of Steins;Gate is very simple and makes no sense, the works itself is in fact the best among all time travelling fictions I have ever watched. I strongly recommend watching Steins;Gate if anyone haven\'t!","ifs2l3l1p0":"Psychopass is a Cyberpunk Anime about criminals, and it gives me lots of deep thoughts that I have never seen elsewhere. The first season of Psychopass is written by Urobuchi Gen, which I think is far better than the sequels. The second season is obviously a little disappointing, but the third season brings some new ideas and is very interesting. I am very curious about what stories will be like next.","ifs2l3l2p0":"Monogatari series are about mysteries. The author made everyone into a Kaii so as to talk about humanities. The novels are already interesting enough, yet I was more deeply impressed by the Anime version developed by Sinbou Akiyuki. To be frank, I have never expected an Anime to go beyond its original work, except for Monogatari.","gmh":"Game Achievements","gms0":"Touhou","gms1":"CAVE","gms2":"Hollow
