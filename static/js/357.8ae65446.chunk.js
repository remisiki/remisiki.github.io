Memory allocation is quite tough to use, yet later finding it quite useful since no modern high level languages (except Rust maybe) can manage memory so directly. I know C is more widely used in hardware programming, but I have no practical experience in that and no plans to dig more into it currently\u2026","pascal":"Studied as the first programming language. Used to use Turbo Pascal and Free Pascal as my IDE, and I still remember the blue background and some keyboard shortcuts which reminds me of the old-school programming style. I attended several programming matches in Pascal, but later turned to C++ instead since I do not want to write sort by hand every time :)","cpp":"Used as the main programming language in my high school days, though I cannot believe that I learnt it all on my own without Google or StackOverflow. Used to use Dev-CPP as IDE, but turned to text editor + terminal later. I have not been coding in C++ for so long since entering university that it is hard for me to develop a project in C++ now\u2026","java":"A widely used language exclaiming to be better than C++. I do not know very well about JVM, but I think it is quite strong. The programming style fascinates me a lot, and I prefer to use Java to develop a non-script software at present. I used Eclipse Java during my internship, but I do prefer to use text editor + terminal for personal projects (cannot get used to IDE anyway, personally).","scala":"A scalable language developed based on Java, but the style is somehow quite similar to Elm and Python. I came to know about Scala from Apache Spark packages and I believe Scala can be a quite powerful tool in machine learning other than Python. I only know about general grammar at present and have written a small web backend with PlayFramework.","python":"Very convenient script and machine learning tool. It takes no time to write a Python script, so I often use it when I am lazy enough. I am currently studying machine learning in Python, but I do not like it quite much since Python\'s performance is so poor and also too hard to maintain as a big project. I hope that Python can be replaced one day, honestly.","riscv":"Learnt together with Verilog in some college courses about CPU. Assembly is interesting, yet too difficult to actually code on. May also want to learn about x86-64 Assembly.","verilog":"A hardware description language. Quite convenient to use, but also drives one mad on some timing problems. Once in a period I liked hardware coding a lot, however, I am not planning to work more with it in the future.","vb":"An out-dated user interface design tool. I suppose that no one will use it nowadays\u2026 And I learnt it quite a couple of years ago to produce many small programs that I cannot find them today. What I do remember is that IDE will alert you a syntax error if accidently leaving a line without completing it :)","javascript":"A powerful frontend language. I first got to know JavaScript when taking a course that taught Elm.js, a language that nobody should have known about. Elm is a functional programming language, and I find it quite fresh to write functions in a pipeline style. I also wrote some webpages with pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS before using React.js. React is convenient, and there appears to be quite many things for me to dig in web design. I can only write simple static webpages right now, and may want to learn more about dynamic ones in the future. Besides, I have started using Node.js with Electron recently to build desktop apps, and wrapping frontend and backend which are both written in JavaScript is quite incredible.","ifh":"About Remisiki","ifp0":"Remisiki is a junior student major in ECE (Electrical & Computer Engineering), who likes programming and single-player games. Planning to join the graduate program in US Michigan School of Information in 2022 Fall.","ifs0":"Languages","ifs1":"Programming","ifs2":"Interests","ifenp0":"Can read most English without difficulties, but writing and speaking is not very good\u2026 If you find some words improper here or in other my pages, please let me know!","ifenp1":"I have been taking all my undergraduate courses in English, so I think there is no problem with my professional English. But when actually travelling to English-speaking countries, I found native speakers all talking so fast that I could not understand them\u2026","ifenp2":"Personally speaking, I like British accents since they always sound quite \\"gentlemen\\" (?).","ifcnp0":"Both Peking Mandarin and Taiwan Mandarin are OK with me. For writing, I prefer traditional Chinese (they are nicer). In fact, modern Chinese pronunciation (Mandarin) is too simple and I do not like it very much\u2026 If possible, I will talk in Shanghainese instead.","ifshp0":"Native language, spoken from my earliest childhood. I like it, but few people know about Shanghainese nowadays :(","ifhkp0":"Not so familiar with, but know many about it. Maybe better at listening than speaking? Since there is no chance for me to practice speaking Cantonese (at least now).","ifhkp1":"Pronunciations are very interesting, and many similar points can be found between Cantonese and Japanese Kanji. ","ifjap0":"Quite familiar with, yet still far from mastering. Listening and reading are OK, but writing Japanese needs google translate sometimes\u2026","ifdep0":"Knows very limited about it. I have just started learning German, so conversations are not possible at present\u2026","ifp1":"Click on the items to see more details!","ifp2":"My regular gears and favorite text editors for programming:","ifp2l0":"Desktop PC (Windows 10 with WSL Ubuntu)","ifp2l1":"Notebook PC (Manjaro Linux & Windows 11)","ifp2l2":"Sublime Text","ifs0l0":"English","ifs0l1":"Chinese","ifs0l2":"Japanese","ifs0l3":"German","ifs0l1l0":"Mandarin","ifs0l1l1":"Shanghainese","ifs0l1l2":"Cantonese","ifs2l0":"STG","ifs2l0l0":"Touhou","ifs2l0l1":"CAVE","ifs2l1":"Metroidvania","ifs2l1l0":"Hollow Knight","ifs2l1l1":"Ender Lilies","ifs2l1l2":"Ori","ifs2l2":"Other games","ifs2l2l0":"Steins;Gate","ifs2l2l1":"Steins;Gate 0","ifs2l2l2":"htoL#NiQ","ifs2l3":"Anime","ifs2l3l0":"Steins;Gate","ifs2l3l1":"Psychopass","ifs2l3l2":"Monogatari","ifs2l0l0p0":"Started playing Touhou since 2016, and (almost) stopped after 2019. For details of achievements, see the Game tab.","ifs2l0l0p1":"Favorite Touhou game is TH12 \u6771\u65b9\u661f\u84ee\u8239 \uff5e Undefined Fantastic Object; Others like TH06 \u6771\u65b9\u7d05\u9b54\u90f7 \uff5e the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, TH11 \u6771\u65b9\u5730\u970a\u6bbf \u301c Subterranean Animism are also excellent. I bought both CD and Steam version (except TH06) for these three games, and I think their game content and music are among the best of all Touhou games. Although I also played the new games as soon as they are released, I do not think they are better than those before, so gradually I stopped playing Touhou anymore\u2026","ifs2l0l0p2":"My favorite Touhou character is Remilia Scarlet, and that\'s where my name Remisiki came from. Vampire is good!","ifs2l0l1p0":"Started playing CAVE games since 2019. At first, I could only play them on PC simulators with keyboard; Then in 2020 I bought a joystick controller so that I could practice CAVE at home, which helped me a lot when I actually go to Rekka Game Center in Shanghai to play on real arcade machines.","ifs2l0l1p1":"Favorite CAVE game is Dodonpachi Daioujou, and favorite music is \u300eStage 5: EVAC INDUSTRY-\u5be9\u5224\u306e\u65e5\u300f. I do not own a PS4/Xbox 360, so I can only buy a few of CAVE games at present, sadly; Hope that more CAVE games can be transplanted to Steam in recent years.","ifs2l1l0p0":"Hollow Knight is my first Metroidvania game. I started playing it since late 2019 (expecting Silksong to be released soon), and have spent around 1,000 hours on it until now. Hollow Knight is a wonderful game with plentiful contents and excellent operation experience; Before Silksong is released (hope it will), I will mainly run on Randomizer MOD and Any%/112% Speedrun.","ifs2l1l1p0":"Ender Lilies is my second favorite Metroidvania game. I first played it\'s early access on 2021 and liked it quite much. The story is excellent but too short\u2026 I would be very satisfied if the game had been developed into a bigger one so that I could spend more time on it. Currently I run Randomizer MOD and 100% Map Speedrun for Ender Lilies.","ifs2l1l1p1":"It seems that not so many Metroidvania players know about Ender Lilies, and I think it should receive more attention than now.","ifs2l1l2p0":"Just started playing Ori 1, and currently stopping for perhaps several months. I think it is more difficult than Hollow Knight or Ender Lilies, and some new moving skills are quite cool. Yes, a hard game.","ifs2l2l0p0":"Steins;Gate is one of the best game I\'ve ever played. Already spent 50 hours on it, but still far from all achievements. I think it is quite hard to reach the true ending without viewing strategy guides, and the saving slots are not enough to do it all on one\'s own though.","ifs2l2l0p1":"Favorite character is Faris NyanNyan, cried a lot when sacrificing her to reach other ends :( Besides, music is very good and I can recall all of them clearly; I even set \u300eGATE OF STINER -Piano-\u300f as my ringtone!","ifs2l2l1p0":"Steins;Gate 0 can be seen as a sequel or Part 0 of Steins;Gate. But I think they should be combined together to construct a complete story, since Steins;Gate 0 is necessary to reach Steins;Gate.","ifs2l2l1p1":"As a game itself, I think Steins;Gate 0 is really wonderful and does not lose to Steins;Gate. The true ending route is more interesting and strongly connected to other routes, so all routes are important to understand the whole story.","ifs2l2l1p2":"The music is undoubtedly excellent, sometimes rearranging with Steins;Gate. Waiting for so long before the Reawake appears though.","ifs2l2l2p0":"I played htoL#NiQ mainly because the girl in this game is really similar to that in Ender Lilies (cute) and there are some Metroidvania elements other than riddle solving.","ifs2l2l2p1":"This game is extremely hard. I still cannot complete the last several achievements, and the mouse operation is so tough for me. Despite the difficulty, it is a wonderful game and I would also like to try other Nipponichi games in the future.","ifs2l3l0p0":"Steins;Gate is already my favorite Anime before playing the games, and I like it even more after rewatching it with all game routes cleared.","ifs2l3l0p1":"The most touching scene in Steins;Gate is that Okarin stabbed himself when trying to save Makise, and in Steins;Gate 0 is that Okarin reawaked and laughed UAHAHAHAHA for two minutes.","ifs2l3l0p2":"Although the science part of Steins;Gate is very simple and makes no sense, the works itself is in fact the best among all time travelling fictions I have ever watched. I strongly recommend watching Steins;Gate if anyone haven\'t!","ifs2l3l1p0":"Psychopass is a Cyberpunk Anime about criminals, and it gives me lots of deep thoughts that I have never seen elsewhere. The first season of Psychopass is written by Urobuchi Gen, which I think is far better than the sequels. The second season is obviously a little disappointing, but the third season brings some new ideas and is very interesting. I am very curious about what stories will be like next.","ifs2l3l2p0":"Monogatari series are about mysteries. The author made everyone into a Kaii so as to talk about humanities. The novels are already interesting enough, yet I was more deeply impressed by the Anime version developed by Sinbou Akiyuki. To be frank, I have never expected an Anime to go beyond its original work, except for Monogatari.","gmh":"Game Achievements","gms0":"Touhou","gms1":"CAVE","gms2":"Hollow Knight","gms0p0":"is the first cleared character.","gms0l0":"TH06 Embodiment of Scarlet Devil","gms0l1":"TH07 Perfect Cherry Blossom","gms0l2":"TH08 Imperishable Night","gms0l3":"TH09 Phantasmagoria of Flower View","gms0l4":"TH10 Mountain of Faith","gms0l5":"TH11 Subterranean Animism","gms0l6":"TH12 Undefined Fantastic Object","gms0l7":"TH13 Ten Desires","gms0l8":"TH14 Double Dealing Character","gms0l9":"TH15 Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom","gms0l10":"TH16 Hidden Star in Four Seasons","gms0l11":"TH17 Wily Beast and Weakest Creature","gms0l12":"TH18 Unconnected Marketeers","gms0lcc":"Lunatic cleared: ","gms0excc":"Extra cleared: ","gms0nbcc":"Lunatic no bomb: ","gms0l0hc":"Reimu A","gms0l0l1":"Reimu A","gms0l1hc":"Sakuya A","gms0l1l0p0":"Reimu A, Reimu B, Marisa A, Marisa B, ","gms0l1l0p1":", Sakuya B","gms0l1l1":"Reimu A","gms0l1l2":"Reimu A","gms0l2hc":"Reimu & Yukari","gms0l2l0":", Marisa & Alice, Sakuya & Remilia, Youmu & Yuyuko, Reimu, Remilia","gms0l2l1":"Reimu & Yukari, Remilia","gms0l2l2":"Reimu & Yukari","gms0l3hc":"Reisen","gms0l4hc":"Marisa C","gms0l4l0":"Reimu B, Marisa B, ","gms0l4l1":"Reimu B","gms0l5hc":"Marisa A","gms0l5l0":"Reimu A, ","gms0l6hc":"Sanae B","gms0l6l0":"Reimu A, ","gms0l6l1":"Sanae B","gms0l7hc":"Reimu","gms0l7l0":", Youmu","gms0l7l1":"Reimu","gms0l8hc":"Reimu A","gms0l8l1":"Reimu A","gms0l9lcc":"Lunatic cleared (legacy mode): ","gms0l9hc":"Sanae","gms0l10hc":"Reimu (summer)","gms0l10l0":", Chiruno (summer), Aya (summer), Marisa (summer)","gms0l11hc":"Youmu B","gms0l11l0":"Reimu A, Reimu B, Marisa B, Youmu A, ","gms0l11l1":"Reimu A, Reimu B, Youmu A, Youmu B","gms0l12hc":"Reimu","gms0l12l1":"Reimu","gms11cc":"First loop 1cc: ","gms1mncc":"Maniac 1cc: ","gms1dscc":"Level 2 1cc: ","gms15o":"Stage 5","gms1l0":"Dodonpachi Daioujou (Black Label)","gms1l1":"Dodonpachi Daioujou (White Label)","gms1l2":"Dodonpachi Daifukkatsu (White Label)","gms1l3":"Mushihimesama","gms1l4":"Death Smiles","gms1l5":"Ketsui: Kizuna Jigoku Tachi","gms1l6":"Dodonpachi Daifukkatsu (Black Label)","gms1l0l0":"BEx","gms1l1l0":"BEx","gms1l2l0":"BStr","gms1l3l0":"W-Power","gms1l4l0":"Windia","gms2l0":"Any% NMG Speedrun","gms2l0p0":"PB: 45:38\u3000Ver 1.5.78","proj0":"Homepage Web App","proj1":"Telegram Pixiv Illust Bot","proj2":"Activity Count for UM-JI Canvas","proj3":"Barcoding Data Processing Tool","proj4":"Random Pixiv Artworks Webpage","proj5":"Remisiki\'s QQ","proj6":"Data transfer within a LAN","projji":"UM-JI Course File","des0":"I am in game center A-cho now!","des1":"I\'ve found Seirensen in Akiba but only Seirensen is left \ud83d\ude22","des2":"My new joystick completed!","hms0t":"Welcome to Remisiki\'s Homepage!","hms0p0p0":"This is my first homepage website made with ","hms0p0p1":", and please forgive me for not being familiar with web design\u2026","hms0p1":"Homepage mainly contains my portfolio, public repositories, game status or other interests, galleries and future blogs if I have time to post some.","hms0p2":"Feel free to move around to other tabs!","hms0p3p0":"My profile icon comes from ","hms0p3p1":"here","hms0p3p2":".","hms1t":"Social Accounts","hms1p0":"Twitter (study):","hms1p1":"Github:","hms1p2":"Telegram:","hms1p3":"Twitter (game):","hms1p4":"Discord:","hms1p5":"Steam:","hms1p6":"YouTube:","hms1p7":"E-Mail:","hms1p8p0":"I use Twitter and Telegram quite often for private messages.
